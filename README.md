Code and data relating to:

Sequence effects on patterns of variation observed from whole-genome sequenced UK Biobank participants
David Curtis
d.curtis@ucl.ac.uk

Data consists of counts of variants obtained from 500,000 UK Biobank participants

Contents of counts directory

Note that variants are specified as pentanucleotide background followed by base which replaces central base
So ACGTTA represents AC[G>A]TT, CGTCGC represents CG[T>C]CG, etc.

counts.chr.x.txt - variant counts
chr is chromosome or total
x = 0 - SNP variants with allele count >=3
x = 1 - variants with allele count =2
x = 2 - singleton variants with allele count =1

backgroundCounts.chr.txt - pentanucleotide counts in the reference sequence 

frequencies.chr.x.txt - variant frequencies, variant count divided by count of reference sequence background

Contents of src directory

*.?pp - C++ source
makeExe.sh - bash script to compile C++ executables, requires DLIB from https://dlib.net/
makeVariantPlots.20260214.R - code to produce plots
